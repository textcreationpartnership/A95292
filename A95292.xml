            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Some fled into the Church, others out of the Town to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Che≈øter, but were pur≈øued gallantly by that valiant Captain <hi>Zanchy,</hi> who commands Sir <hi>William Breretons</hi> own Troop, within pi≈øtoll ≈øhot of the walls of Che≈øter. A Gentleman of Sir <hi>William Breretons</hi> Troop, named Mr. <hi>Dury,</hi> killed one of the enemy clo≈øe at the workes of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter.</hi> And that while they were in pur≈øute of the enemie towards Che≈øter, the re≈øt were not idle in Tarvin: For that worthy valiant Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Jones,</hi> who commanded the Hor≈øe, behaved him≈øelfe gallantly: and ≈øo did that valiant Major <hi>Trevas,</hi> who commanded the Foot.

               <p>THe ≈øtrength of this bloody Prince in his Hor≈øe, is much abated: For at <hi>Wel≈øhpoole</hi> there was taken by Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> Colonell <hi>Mitton,</hi> with the a≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of <hi>Che≈øhire</hi> Forces, three hundred fourty ≈øix hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of <hi>Ruperts</hi> own Regiment. And the ≈øame week was taken by Colonell <hi>A≈øhton,</hi> at <hi>Holland</hi> in <hi>Lanca≈øhire,</hi> two hundred Hor≈øe; and at <hi>Pre≈øton</hi> in <hi>Lanca≈øhire</hi> about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcore hor≈øe: And at the la≈øt skirmi≈øh by the <hi>Lanca≈øhire</hi> Forces at <hi>Ormskirk</hi> in <hi>Lanca≈øhire,</hi> abovt nine hundred hor≈øe, and by Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> at <hi>Tarvin,</hi> three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hor≈øe, which in all make up neere upon a thou≈øand eight hundred hor≈øe, be≈øides pri≈øoners.</p>
               <p>THough ≈øome time be over-pa≈øt, yet I cannot altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let ≈øleep in oblivion tho≈øe many noble actions of Colonell <hi>Fox,</hi> not yet in publick view: A little while ≈øince upon the di≈øcovery of the quartering of Worce≈øter Forces in Upton Warren, ≈øome twelve miles from his Garri≈øon, he went forth with a partie of hor≈øe, and tooke in their quarters Captain <hi>Milward;</hi> one Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Dudley,</hi> as appeared by a commi≈ø≈øion found in his pocket, Lieutenant <hi>Newbery,</hi> quarterma≈øter <hi>Dod,</hi> two Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, ten other Souldiers, and twenty hor≈øe; with the≈øe he al≈øo brought a drove of bea≈øts from the Earl of <hi>Shrew≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:112446:5"/>
A little after he took Captain <hi>Knight</hi> in his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at Stoak, neer Brom≈øgrove.</p>
               <p>The 16. of this Augu≈øt, upon intelligence that the Commi≈ø≈øion of Array ≈øate in execution therof at Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber≈øley four miles from Worce≈øter, and 17. from Egber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon garri≈øon, de≈øired my Lord of Denbies forces to joyn with him for their apprehen≈øion, which was accordingly attempted, where they took 40. pri≈øoners, divers being men of note, 130 brave hor≈ø, 150 bea≈øts, mo≈øt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners very hardly e≈øcaped, which they had not done, but by rea≈øon of ≈øome delayes of tho≈øe that commanded the Earls forces, being bu≈øied with ≈øome other de≈øignes neerer Worce≈øter, contrary to the Colonels direction and de≈øire, yet notwith≈øtanding by rea≈øon of the Colonel and his cubs pur≈øuit after them over the river Severne, where they were inforced to ≈øwim, hee recovered divers excellent hor≈øe and Armes, and returned with this prize in ≈øafety. In this expedition young Capt. <hi>Cotton</hi> behaved him≈øelf very valiantly. Upon the 20. of this moneth the Colonell having intelligence of ≈øome Cavaliers to lie in Brom≈øgrove, ≈øent forth a party of hor≈øe under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Capt. <hi>Tadman,</hi> and Capt. <hi>John≈øon,</hi> who ≈øurprized in that place, Capt. <hi>Barn≈øley</hi> and his ≈øouldiers, he being a Gentleman of quality, and a Worce≈øter Captain: This noble Colonels practice is ≈øuch, that no Cavalier is heard of in the countrey, but he brings him to his den: neither dare any enemy come out of Worce≈øter to oppo≈øe his proceedings, in≈øomuch that the greate≈øt malignants, and Papi≈øts ≈øeeek to make their peace with us, confe≈ø≈øing their errors.</p>
